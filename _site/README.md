Tech and Music

This repository uses a single index page for the site.

Site focus
- I write about things I learn in software engineering (tutorials, tips, notes) and Western classical music (theory, analysis, practice).

Where to write site content
- The homepage is `/index.markdown` â€” edit that to change the entire site content.
- Additional pages (optional): `/about.md` with YAML front matter (`--- layout: page ---`).
- Blog posts are optional; you do not need `_posts/` for a single-page site.
- Preview locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve` or push to GitHub and Pages will build the site.
