I write about things I learn in software engineering and Western classical music.

What I write about
- Software: practical notes, small tutorials, tooling tips, debugging approaches, and design patterns I find useful.
- Western classical music: score study, theory insights, practice notes, repertoire recommendations, and listening guides.
